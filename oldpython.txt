Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used.
We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through
July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population.
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, 
and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, 
we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations.
